        <p>
          My name is Antoine Ansari I am a french cybersecurity engineer living
          in Paris.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work as a secDevOps at Padok. My primary focuses are on
          cloud, kubernetes and CI/CD security. I also sometimes do pentesting.

        <p>
          I work as a SecDevOps at Padok, I deal with cybersecurity missions in
          Cloud and DevOps environments. I have an engineering degree in
          cybersecurity after a work-study at BNP Paribas. It's been 4 years I
          work in cybersecurity now and I really enjoy it ! ü•≥

          <p>
            Kubernetes may be my favorite technology. I've had the opportunity
            to manage large clients' Kubernetes clusters in previous projects.
            It's a powerful tool with numerous security challenges, from RBAC
            management to container security. Recently, I implemented network
            policies on an existing cluster for production.

            >I've worked on GCP projects, though it's the cloud provider I've
            used the least. To enhance my knowledge of securing this provider, I
            obtained the Cloud Security Engineer certification (click on the
            text to check it).</a

          <p>
            I greatly enjoy working with AWS and have completed numerous
            projects using this cloud provider. I've secured several client
            infrastructures using AWS WAF and Security Hub. Setting up IAM can
            be more complex than on other cloud providers, in my opinion. AWS is
            also the cloud provider I use for my personal projects.

        <div class="tech-item">
          <img src="assets/Microsoft-Azure.png" alt="Azure" />
          <p>
            While Azure is my least favorite cloud provider, it's the one in
            which I have the most expertise. I've encountered numerous issues
            and bugs with this provider, and I feel Microsoft's response to them
            is not always adequate, considering their market share. One positive
            aspect of Azure is the managed identities, which greatly simplify
            setting up applications without credentials.

        <div class="tech-item">
          <img src="assets/Git.png" alt="Git" />
          <p>
            In various missions, I've worked on multiple Git integrations,
            primarily focusing on securing CI/CD pipelines for clients. My
            preferred integration for self-hosted runners is GitLab. I've also
            worked with GitHub, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps. I've found
            Bitbucket's CI/CD functionality to be lacking, with numerous
            unresolved issues lingering for years.

        <div class="tech-item">
          <img src="assets/Linux.png" alt="Linux" />
          <p>
            I use Linux on both my work PC and main PC. Despite its critics, I
            enjoy scripting in Bash. My preferred distribution is Ubuntu with
            Mate desktop environment üêß (not arch linux btw).

          <p>
            I frequently undertake pentesting missions, predominantly black box
            and grey box. In my spare time, I enjoy participating in CTFs or
            exploring challenges on platforms like Root-Me. While my ranking may
            not be high, I'm actively working on improving my skills ()

        <p>
          I also enjoy teaching. Through my work, I've had the opportunity to
          teach basic DevOps and Kubernetes security to postgraduate students at
          two French engineering schools. Each session was a one-day
          masterclass, one focusing on DevOps and the other on Kubernetes
          security. For the latter, I collaborated with a colleague to create a
          CTF challenge centered around Kubernetes security.

        <p>
          I've given several talks at meetups, with the latest being at the
          OWASP France chapter meetup. I spoke about the key aspects of
          implementing network policies in a Kubernetes cluster, drawing mainly
          from my experience on one of my projects. Additionally, I led a
          workshop on attacking a Kubernetes cluster.
