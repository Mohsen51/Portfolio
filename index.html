        <hr />
        <p>
          My name is Antoine Ansari I am a french cybersecurity engineer living
          in Paris.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work as a secOps at Padok. My primary focuses are on
          cloud, kubernetes and CI/CD security. I also sometimes do pentesting.

        <hr />
        <p>
          I work as a SecOps at Padok, I deal with cybersecurity missions in
          Cloud and DevOps environments. I have an engineering degree in
          cybersecurity after a work-study at BNP Paribas. It's been 4 years I
          work in cybersecurity now and I really enjoy it ! ü•≥

          <p>
            Kubernetes may be my own favorite technology. I had the opportunity
            to manage big client's kubernetes clusters in my previous projects.
            This is a really powerful tool with a lot of security challenges :
            from RBAC management to container security. I also recently
            implemented network policies on an existing cluster until
            production.

            >I had the opportunity to work on GCP projects. Although this is the
            cloud provider I used the less, I passed the Cloud Security Engineer
            certification to improve my knowledge in securing this cloud
            provider (click on the text to check it).</a

        <div class="tech-item">
          <img src="assets/aws.png" alt="AWS" />
          <p>
            I really enjoy AWS and I have worked on a lot of projects using this
            cloud provider. I secured several client infrastructure using AWS
            WAF and security Hub. A lot of mistakes can be made upon setting up
            IAM as it is more complex than on other cloud providers in my
            opinion. This is the cloud provider I use on my personal projects.

        <div class="tech-item">
          <img src="assets/Microsoft-Azure.png" alt="Azure" />
          <p>
            Although this is my least favorite cloud provider, it may be the one
            on which I have the most expertise in. I found a lot of issues and
            bugs using this cloud provider and I feel like Microsoft response to
            them is not adapated and satisfying for such a company with such
            market share. One good thing about Azure are the managed identities
            which help a lot setting up no credentials applications.

        <div class="tech-item">
          <img src="assets/Git.png" alt="Git" />
          <p>
            In my several missions I had the opportunity to work on several Git
            integrations. Most of my projects consisted in securing CICD for
            clients. My favorite integration to work with self hosted runners is
            GitLab. I also had the opportunity to work with gitHub, bitbucket
            and azure Devops. I found bitbucket CICD terrible with a lot of
            unresolved issues opened sometimes for more than 5 years.

        <div class="tech-item">
          <img src="assets/Linux.png" alt="Linux" />
          <p>
            I use linux on my work PC and main PC. I like scripting in bash even
            though I know it is somehow really criticized and hated by some. I
            use ubuntu with mate üêß (not arch linux btw).

          <p>
            I often do pentesting missions, mostly black box and grey box. I
            also like to do CTFs on my free time or have fun on root-me. My
            ranking is not that high but I would like to get better.

        <p>
          I also really like teaching. I had the opportunity thanks to my work
          to teach basic devOps and kubernetes security to post graduate
          students at two french engineering schools.
